# login-system
A simple registration / login system I wrote in order to practice with C++ and OOP in general. It includes a C++ implementation of SHA256.

The SHA256 implementation is in the header file, while the main login system is in the main C++ file.

Planning on adding more encryption methods to encryption.h
